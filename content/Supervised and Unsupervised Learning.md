# Supervised Learning
Learn a mapping from inputs x to output y, given a labeled set of input-output pairs. 
It can be:
- Regression  
- Classification

Supervised learning is when we have a clear understanding of what we want to know. We need to have labeled data. We can use classification or regression for this.

# Unsupervised Learning
- Given data, find “interesting patterns” in the data.  
- Sometimes called knowledge discovery  
- Much less well-defined problem, no obvious error metric  
- Clustering  
- Recommender systems  
- Association rules
