# Regression Discontinuity
People just above the thresh-hold get treated, and the people just below do not get treated. There is an arbitrary cut-off. The closer you are to the cut-off/thresh-hold the more similar you are. This looks like a randomized experiment. And we can compare these to groups of people.

First study that invented Regression Discontinuity, 1960.
National merit scholarship program started 1950. 16000 of the highest students are given a certificate of merit are 2.5 likely to be mentioned in news paper articles. Those student additionally got but in books and to scholarships firms. Those who got the merit got in essence more publicity. The difference between the group below cutoff with the group above is the treatment-effect.

The limitation of Regression Discontinuity is that the treatment effect is only representing the effect for the "people" close to the cutoff. If the cut-off changed, the treatment effect might not be the same.

There is two types of regression discontinuity. The shock/sharp and the fuzzy. The sharp we have a fixed value for thresh-hold/cut-off. The fuzzy RD is more continuous thresh-hold.

One can detect a fuzzy RD by looking at the percentage between each side of the cutoff. If one size has 0% and the other side had 100%, this is a shock/sharp RD. If it has more than 0% and less than 100% it is a fuzzy RD. An example of this is from Swiss where they had a border between Catholics and Protestants in 1860(?).

Experiments like this is more difficult to find than you expect.
