# Randomized Trials
When analyzing data form a randomized trial or any other research design, masters almost always begin with a check on whether treatment and control groups indeed look similar. This process, called *checking for balance*, amounts to a comparison of sample averages. It is worth checking for balance any time you are estimating casual effects.

The idea of randomized controlled trail emerge in earnest only at the beginning of the twentieth century , in the work of statistician and geneticist [[Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher]], who analyzed data form agricultural experiments.

Random sampling and random assignment are closely related but distinct ideas.
