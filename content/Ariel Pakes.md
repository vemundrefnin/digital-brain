He received the Frisch Medal of the Econometric Society in 1986.

He was the Distinguished Fellow of the Industrial Organization Society in 2007. He received the Jean-Jaques Laffont Prize in 2017 and the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in 2018.  
Pakes' research focuses on developing methods for empirically analyzing market responses to environmental and policy changes. This includes the analysis of demand systems and price changes, productivity, and the evolution of markets over time. He also has developed techniques for constructing a more accurate Consumer Price Index. He and his co-authors have applied these tools to analysis of the automobile, electric utility, health care, and telecommunications equipment industries. Pakes has mentored more than 60 doctoral students, many of whom are now leading researchers. Much of his methodological research has been incorporated into the work of government agencies.

He is married with two children, a son-in-law, and a granddaughter. They all enjoy hiking, jazz, and watching the NBA.
