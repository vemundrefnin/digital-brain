# Public or Private Digital Brain
When it comes to choosing to have the Digital ðŸ§  public or not there is three options. 

1. Private, the Github repo and the digital brain website is only accessible for me.
2. Partly private, the Github repo is private but the digital brain website is public or partly public with some private notes.
3. Public, the Github repo and the digital brain website is public.

These three options will be described in the next chapters.

## Private
This is archived with a private repo, but I am not sure how the website can be privet while still be available for me. Before it is even relevant to look into wether this is possible I have to understand why a private website would be preferable and if I need a website at all if it is private.

I think the only reason I want to have a private website is because it would make it accessable on any device.
