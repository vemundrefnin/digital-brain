# Handle Tags in Obsidian and on the Quartz Website

**Problem**: I want to use obsidians nice autosuggestions when adding tags, but this is not possible when adding tags that is understandable for Quartz (Hugo under the hood).

A few things to know about tags for Quartz and Obisdian.
- The tags described for Quartz are working and searchable in Obsidian
- If a Quartz tag starts with # it is not showing on the web
- When writing Quartz tags no autosuggestion is showing
- When writing Obsidian tags (starting with #)autosuggestion is showing

## Resources for solving the problem
[Serhii Hamotsky blog post](https://serhii.net/blog/it/2021-11-29-211129-0126-obsidian-to-hugo-tags-script-and-template/) has a hacky solution with issues.
