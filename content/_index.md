title: ðŸ§  VemundÂ´s Digital Brain
---

This is my Digital Garden.

Almost every note I take will be accessible here. It does not matter if it is related to work, school, feelings, opinions or if it is unfinished or not correct.

Generally everything I write is public, but due to different privacy reasons some notes might not be accessible for the public.

This digital brain might not have a structure that makes sense for someone else, but I strive to make the links and structure of the notes as close to how my brain works as possible.

If you want to get access to private notes, want to help by changing the notes or have any other questions, please contact me at vemund.refnin@gmail.com and you might get access to my private ![github](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) repository where this ðŸ§  is stored. I have been struggling to decide wether the repo should be public or private. You can read more about my though process in the note: [[Public or Private Digital Brain]]
