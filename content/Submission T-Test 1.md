$H_0$: There is no significance of the humidity level from the mean.
$H_1$: There is a significance of the humidity level from the mean.
$\alpha=0.05$
$0.0001< 0.05$, this means we reject $H_0$.
Thus there is a significance of the humidity level form the mean.

NOTE: always getting the same values for this example even if Alternative hypothesis: mu ^= XX is changed.
