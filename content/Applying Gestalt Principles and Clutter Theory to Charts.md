# Applying Gestalt Principles and Clutter Theory to Charts

Throughout this document I will explain how Gestalt principle can be applied to a selection of charts. I will also use what I have learned from chapter 3 in the textbook to comment on the charts.

Before looking at the charts it is important to have a good understanding of the Gestalt principles. The Gestalt principles were developed in the 1900s. It is six principles of visual perceptions that describe how individuals perceive order in the world around them.

The first principle is _proximity_. It states that objects close to one another belong in the same group. As you can see in figure 3.1, we naturally see that the dots are in three different groups.

The second principle is _similarity_. We think similar objects belong in the same group. Object can be perceived as similar if they for example have the same color or the same shape as you can see in figure 3.3.

_Enclosure_ is the third principle. This principle states that physically enclosed objects belong in the same group. As you can see in figure 3.5, _enclosure_ can be a type of box capturing several dots.

The next principle is _closure_. Several individual elements tend to be perceived as a single set. Therefore, we for example do not need a border around a line chart as you can see in figure 3.8.

The _continuity_ principle is fairly similar to the _closure_ principle. _Continuity_ states that we tend to fill in the blanks and the things we do not see. An example of this is displayed in figure 3.9. If we look at object set 1, we intuitively think that the result of pulling the objects apart will look like object set 2. But it could be the object set 3. This principle can be applied by for example removing unnecessary axis because our brain fills in the blanks, namely the axis.

The last principle is _connection_. This states that physically connected objects belong in the same group. Se figure 3.11 for an example of this.

Apart from the Gestalt principles chapter three also focus on the importance of eliminating clutter. The message will not come across if the cognitive load is too big. Therefore, it is important to minimize clutter. Clutter can be eliminated by the use of the Gestalt principles, but chapter three also states a few other ways of doing this.

Rotated text should be avoided to eliminate clutter. 45-degree rotated text is read 52% slower, 90-degree rotated text is read 205% slower. Chapter three also explains that the use of diagonal lines and centered text should be avoided to minimize clutter.

The most important thing of a chart is to show the data. By using high contrast colors on parts that do not highlight data will inflict an unnecessary cognitive load on the viewer. Chapter 3 says that this type of color use should be avoided but using contrasting colors in a well thought out manner can be a powerful tool to clearly mediate the message.

The Gestalt principles and the suggestions provided int chapter 3 can be used to improve already created charts. In the rest of this document, I will look at different charts and how they can be improved.

The Gestalt principle about closure suggests that it is unnecessary to have borders around a line chart. Having this closure (with the black or blue background color) can be interpreted as clutter. We want as little clutter as possible because more cluster will increase the cognitive load required from the reader. It is important to minimize the cognitive load to make the message we want to send be as clear as possible.

In my opinion the white background chart is preferable. Because it does not violate the _closure_ principle and the has an effective use of contrast to clearly mediate the data.

More context is needed to further evaluate these charts based on the Gestalt principles. The lack of context makes it impossible to understand whether the use of _connectivity_ makes sense. It is also difficult to understand if the _continuity_ principle can be applied here, making for example the y-axis obsolete.

My first impression is that this chart is cluttered. That is usually a clear sign that some of the Gestalt principles can be applied to improve the chart.

I think the descriptions on the right side are unnecessary, despite that they satisfy the Gestalt principle about _similarity_ due to the color and _proximity_ due to the location. From the horizontal stacked bar chart, we can clearly see what the "Survey Item A" is the most "Strongly Agree" without the need of a description. Therefore, the descriptions make a clutter and should be removed to make the message clearer.

By applying the _continuity_ principle, I would get rid of the "Percent of Total" axis, because it inflicts unnecessary burden on the audience's cognitive load.

This chart uses the _similarity_ principle because "Disagree | Natural | Agree" are in the same color. _Enclosure_ is used because they are represented with same box in the stacked bar chart. This might be unnecessary clutter and should therefore be only one group instead of three. Unfortunately, the context and the intent of the chart is not available and they might suggest otherwise.

This chart is very similar to the previous, the only difference is the background and the colors.

My evaluation for the previous chart still holds for this chart as well.

Additionally for this chart the black background with the grey shadow inflicts unnecessary burden on the audience's cognitive load. At a minimum it should be changed to a solid color. It is important to remember that the chart is the most important thing and not the background color. Therefor as also mentioned in chapter 3, the use of contrasts should be limited to what is important, namely the data.

The colors and background for this chart is based on the firmâ€™s theme. In my opinion this theme increases the cognitive load inflicted upon the viewer. Therefore, this boils down to the tradeoff question about whether the theme is most important or mediating the message in the clearest possible way.
