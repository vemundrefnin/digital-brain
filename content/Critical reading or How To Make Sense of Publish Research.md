## Identifying the Author´s Argument
1. What question is the author asking?
2. What answer does the author propose (i.e., what is the principle assertion of the study)?
3. In what ways does the study improve upon previous research?
4. How does this the proposed answer compare with that provided by previous research?
5. What are the major logic or theoretical reasons for the author´s argument?
6. What emperical evidence does the author provide?
7. What assumptions is the author making his or her reasoning?

## Evaluating the Author´s argument
1. Does the theoretical analysis make sense?
2. Are the data used adequate to the task?
3. Does the empirical methodology adequately?
4. Are the assumptions reasonable?
5. Is the analysis (theoretical and empirical) clearly explained?
6. Do the conclusions follow from the evidence presented?
7. On balance, is the author´s argument convincing to you?
