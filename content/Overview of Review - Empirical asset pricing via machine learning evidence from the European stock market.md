[[Review - Empirical asset pricing via machine learning evidence from the European stock market]]

Drobetz:

# Main Question

Use machine learning methods to predict returns in European stocks.

## Control Group
In our empirical analysis, we exploit a set of twenty-two
predictors as per the linear FM regressions approach used in
Drobetz etÂ al. (2019). This is our benchmark model, and it is
able to explain a substantial percentage of the cross-sectional
variation in European stock returns.

## Findings
price trends and fundamental signals from valuation ratios.
