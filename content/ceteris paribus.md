# Ceteris Paribus
The latin name for [[other things equal]].

Comparisons made under ceteris paribus conditions have a causal interpretation. Imagine two students identical in every way, so their families have the same financial resources and their parents are similarly educated. One of these virtual twins finances college by borrowing and the other from savings. Because they are otherwise equal in every way (their grandmother has treated both to a small nest egg), differences in their educational attainment can be attributed to the fact that only one has borrowed.
