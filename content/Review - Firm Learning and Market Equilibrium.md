# Review - Firm Learning and Market Equilibrium
Pakes: Improving Nash Equilbrium

I looked into the research paper "Firm Learning and Market Equilibrium" by [[Ariel Pakes]] published in The Reporter by NBER in June 2018.

The motive behind the research is based on the extended use of the theoretical model [[Nash equilibrium]]  to analyze investment responses. This model suggested unrealistic agent behavior when important characteristics of the industry were integrated. That is why this research paper looks into how firms learn in the period where the market is going form one equilibrium to another. It also investigates what is happening in this period, how long it lasts and suggests an improved model will indicate which equilibria are more likely to occur.

The research follow the electric market for FR (frequency response) in the united kingdom after deregulation. FR is used when shock to demand or supply occurs in the electric grid to keep it running.

The FR had previously used a fixed price until November 2005. Post-deregulation the firms submit bids and the research followed this  for six years. The research focus on 10 firms accounted for 85% of the market revenue. Each firm do not know what the other firms bid, but know their previous bids. The FR service can be regarded as identical between the firms because they use generators of same type and vintage.

The research looked at the average and individual bids of the firms and separated them into three periods.

Period 1 has large changes in the average bid and each individual firmÂ´s bids. This research do not try to find a better model for the first period, but focus the analysis on period 2 and 3 to make an adaptive learning model that can outperform the Nash equilibrium. The analysis use the independent variables demand, the firms market position, previous bids from all firms and costs to determine the optimal next bid.

The following graph show the results of the analysis for period 2 and 3.

In the period 2 they describe their model compared to the Nash equilibrium model as following

	The difference between these models and the equilibrium model was both economically and statistically significant.

In the third period both models perform well.

In my opinion this a very interesting and informative paper, but there are a few things I miss. I would like to see more than one example. The example with FR is great because a lot of other unwanted variables seems to be equal, but I would need more examples to be convinced. Especially since their suggested model only is better in a portion of the period they look at.

The other thing I miss is a better explanation of the graphs showing their results. The paper explains that they look at the difference between Nash Equilibrium and their model, but I do not think that is clearly shown in their graphs.
