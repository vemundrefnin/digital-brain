Gram and daughter, firm fondation theory

## Castles in the Air
Crowd of investors is lightly to invest in the future. Buy before the crowd. Also called the grater fool. Psychological and do not matter how the firm is actually doing.

Involves to much work and difficult to learn.

But someone have earned millions of dollars on this.

Behavior finance is the science around this theory.

## Madness of Crowds
### The Dutch Tulip Bulb Market Bobble
A get rich fast scheme in 1593.
The more expensive the tulip bulb, the more people valued the tulip bulb. Everyone imagined the tulip would last forever, many got rich on this because the tulip reach astronomical prices.

Some reasercehers argue that the bobble was not as unrational as we might think.

Like in all Bobbles people start to sell and people panic and sell.

### The South Sea Bobble
[Read more here](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/South-Sea-Bubble/)
300 years ago in England, 1711. A company with no sales or revenue. The world’s first Ponzi scheme, it was very popular.

In 1713 it was granted a trading monopoly in the region. Part of this was the _asiento,_ which allowed for the trading of African slaves to the Spanish and Portuguese Empires. The slave trade had proved immensely profitable in the previous two centuries and there was huge public confidence in the scheme, as many expected slave profits to increase dramatically, especially when the War of the Spanish Succession came to an end and trade could begin in earnest. It didn’t quite play out like that however…

The South Sea Company began by offering those who bought stocks an incredible 6% interest. However, when the War of the Spanish Succession came to an end in 1713 with the Treaty of Utrecht, the expected trade explosion did not happen. Instead, Spain only allowed Britain a limited amount of trade and even took a percentage of the profits. Spain also taxed the importation of slaves and put strict limits on the numbers of ships Britain could send for ‘general trade’, which ended up being a single ship per year. This was unlikely to generate anywhere close to the profit that the South Sea Company needed to sustain it.

This reminded me o the [[East Indian company]] that we see in the [Tv-Show Taboo](Tv-Show%20Taboo.md).
