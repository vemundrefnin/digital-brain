**Enclosure**
Physically enclosed together belong in the same group.
Could for example be a box around a few points.

**Closure**
A set of individual elements tend to be perceived as a set.
Therefore we for example do not need border around a line chart.

**Continuity**
Almost same as *closure*, but *continuity* includes what we do not see. For example if two boxes are partly on top of each other, we think that both boxes are continues without any holes where they overlap.
