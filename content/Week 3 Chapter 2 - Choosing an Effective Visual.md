# Week 3 Chapter 2 - Choosing an Effective Visual

Week 3 discussion [[Example of choosing an effective visual]]

## Secondary Y-axis
Secondary y-axis should be avoided.
Instead think about wether one of the following approaches will meet your needs:
1. DonÂ´t show the axis. Instead, label the data points that belong on this axis directly
2. Pull the graphs apart vertically and have a separate y-axis for each( both along the left) but leverage the same x-axis across both.
