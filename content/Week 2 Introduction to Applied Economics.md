We are going to have an exam. Comprehensive exam.
This is not a theoretic class, but the exam will require knowledge of this.
We can choose if we take the comprehensive exam or write a thesis.
Thesis might be a little more time consuming.
The exam will not be crazy hard, but need to read up for the exam.

[[Review Paper Guide]]
review papers:
- What is the main research question
- Method and data
	- What data is used
	- how many years
	- how to clean data and collect it
- Dependent variables
- Independent variables
- What is done right or wrong, recommendation for improvement

Scary:
1. Difficult words
2. Equations
3. Econometrics
Do not be stuck with this and just continue to read.

## Get a Fast Overview of a Research Paper
Look at last sentences in abstract.
Method is found in the last paragraph in introduction.
Conclusion explains the concrete result.

## Chapter 1 Economic Models Power Point
Empirical paper need theoretical models
Economic models
- Used by economists to describe economic activities
- Most are abstractions from reality
- Provide aid in understanding economic behaviour

Two general methods used to verify economic models:
- Direct approach
  establishes v….In
- …

**Exogenous variable**, outside variables. Variables I can not change such as price of a product.

**Endogenous**, internal variables. Changeable variables. How many people I want to hire.

**Water diamond paradox**: The price of a diamond is much higher than diamond. Even though wee need water more than a diamond, the diamond is more expensive.
The people mining the diamond said it it very demanding to mine diamonds and they ar every rare. Water is easy to get. you can have so much water that additional value of more water is very low.

Endowment effect: taking something hurts more than the happiness you feal when getting exact same thing.

## Presentation
Not high expectant.
Send name of paper to professor.
What was they wanted to answer. What is the question.
what would you do as an extention or diffrently?
athurs and university?
what is your take or creatique.
can have a presentation on powerpoint.
500 word review.

## Economic Models
Empirical economics use real-world data to test and refine models.

Difficult to splitt between correlation and causation.

1. Develop hypothesis
	- Positive (factual) question
	- Do not use Normative (opinion-based) questions
2. develop method of using data
3. Find the data
4. Interpret your findings
