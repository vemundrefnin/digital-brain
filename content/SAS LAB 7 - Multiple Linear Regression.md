$R^2 = 0.86$
This shows relatively high correlation between humidity and air and bulb temp
There were 584 observations. No missing values are reported. For $p=0.05$, it is statistically significant because it is greater than 0.0001 (which is the probability value in the table). this means that any variation in humidity can be explained by air and bulb temp variables.
