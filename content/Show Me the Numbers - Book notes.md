# Show Me the Numbers - Book Notes
A book about how to best display numbers. This is closely related to #visual-analytics #cis5250.

The following notes are only things i found most important from each chapter.

## 1. Introduction
Categorical bar charts should/can be changed to multiple line charts.
Piecharts to horizontal bar charts.

Real purpose of quantitative displays: *to provide the reader with important, meaningful, and useful insight*. To communicate quantitative information effectively requires an understanding of the numbers and the ability to display their message for accurate and efficient interpretation by the reader.

	The overwhelming fact of data graphics is that they stand of fall on their content, gracfully displayed. Above all else show the data.

	If the statistics are boring, then youÂ´ve got the wrong numbers.

-[[Edward Tufte]]

## 3. Differing Roles of Tables and Graphs
No graph or table needed for very little data. Can be explained in a sentence. For example: 
**Q2 Sales = $1,400,000, exceeding forecast by 16%**

But it could be structured in a tabular form such as this:

| Q2 Sales   | Compared to Forecast |
| ---------- | --------------------:|
| $1,400,000 |                 +16% |
or this:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Q2 Sales </th>
    <td>$1,400,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Compared to Forecast</th>
    <td>+16%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Choosing whether to display data in one or mare tables, one ore more graph or some combination fo the two, is  a fundamental challenge of data presentation. This decision should never be arbitrary.

Use a table if one or more of the following is true:
1. The display will be used to look up individual values.
2. It will be used to compare individual values but not entire series of values to one another
3. Precise values are required.
4. The quantitative information to be communicated involves more than one unit of measure.
5. Both summary and detail values are included.

A question I can think of when reading this is: 
"Since the improvement of interactive data visualization do the old theory about graph and table still hold."
