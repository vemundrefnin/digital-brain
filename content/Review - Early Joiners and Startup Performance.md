# Review - Early Joiners and Startup Performance
Choi: The passing of a founder or an early joiner will have large negative effects for the firm.

This is a review of the research paper "Early Joiners and Startup Performance" by Joonkyu Choi, et al. it was published as a working paper in January 2021. The research argue that human capital embodied in founders or early joiners are very important for the growth of the firm. This is done by looking at a natural experiment, comparing deaths of founders and early joiners to deaths of later joiners. Founders and early joiners is herby referred to as "founding team".

They look at all American nonfarm startups between 1990 and 2015 which includes 25000 startups. Deaths of a founding team member in these startups are compared to other similar startups without deaths.
 
They find that death in the founding team is associated with 31% decline in revenue, 15% decline in employment and 22% decline in labor productivity. 

The researcher states that the human capital of the founding team is important for the success of the firm. In my opinion this causality is not perfectly described by only looking at deaths in the founding team. As they also mention in their conclusion, it would be interesting to see endogenous separations such as voluntary departures to dismissals.
