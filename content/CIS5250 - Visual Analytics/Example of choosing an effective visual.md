I think this is a good visualization because it is easy to understand with little to no explanation of the context. I like that the colors are distinguishable and that the years are clearly categorized.

For example, it is easy to se that the use of fish medicine has declined. Since 2017 emamektinbenzoat (purple) has been used the most compare to the other active substances.
