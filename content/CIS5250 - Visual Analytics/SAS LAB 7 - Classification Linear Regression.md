Linear regression equation: 
$y = 3.9 * height- 143.03$

For $p=0.05$ the result are statistically significant because it is greater than 0.0001 (model value given in table). We can conclude that height explains the variation in the weight and age has some impact on this variation. R squared value is 77%.
