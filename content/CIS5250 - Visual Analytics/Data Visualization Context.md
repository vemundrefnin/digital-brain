# Data Visualization Context
To make great data visualizations you need to understand the context. You can understand the context by answering the following questions: 
- Who (To whom are you communicating?)
- What (What do you want your audience to know?)
- How (How can you use data to help make a point?)

It is also a good thing to answer the questions below to get a better understanding of the context. This is especially helpful if someone other than you is requesting the visualization.
- What background information is relevant or essential?
- Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know abut them?
- What biases does our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant to our message?
- What data is available that would strengthen our case? Is our audience familiar with this data, or is it new?
- Where are the risks: what factors could weaken our case and do we need to proactively address them?
- What would a successful outcome look like?
- If you only had a limited amount of time or a single sentence to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say?
