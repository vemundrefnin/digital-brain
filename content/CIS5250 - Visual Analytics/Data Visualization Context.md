# Data Visualization Context
To make great data visualizations you need to understand the context. You can understand the context by answering the following questions: 
- Who (To whom are you communicating?)
- What (What do you want your audience to know?)
- How (How can you use data to help make a point?)

It is also a good thing to answer the questions below to get a better understanding of the context. This is especially helpful if someone other than you is requesting the visualization.
- What background information is relevant or essential?
- Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know abut them?
- What biases does our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant to our message?
- What data is available that would strengthen our case? Is our audience familiar with this data, or is it new?
- Where are the risks: what factors could weaken our case and do we need to proactively address them?
- What would a successful outcome look like?
- If you only had a limited amount of time or a single sentence to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say?

## Example of Data Visualization Context
I want to sell Donuts in Norway.
Who: To potential investors.
What: The popularity of donuts is increasing in Norway, please invest 1 million dollars.
How: The number of places to buy donuts in Norway is increasing.

Here is an example from provided by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries about Norwegian Aquaculture. The following graphs are taken from their annual report of 2021.

Translations:
kvantum laks = amount of salmon
Kvantum regnbueørret = amount of rainbow trout
Salg per sysselsatt = Sale per employee
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220906213748.png)
We can se that the amount fish sold is increasing, but the amount sold per employee is decreasing.

Translatins:
Produksjonskostnad pr. kg = Operation cost per kg
Driftsmargin = Operation margin

Here is an a graph giving an understanding of the profitability during the same time-period as the other graph.

Personally I think it is confusing with numbers on both sides of the y-axis, because I need to figure out which y-axis to a given line.

The things I find interesting about these graps is the fact that sales per employee is decreasing and that the operation margin is greatly fluctuating.
When looking at booth graphs it is interesting  to see that the increase of amount sold do not directly correlate to an increase in operation cost or operation margin.

A who, what, how for this particular example would be the following:

Who: People interested in learning more about Norways current state of aquaculture production and results.

What: There is a lot of useful information that can be taken out of the graphs, but I think they especially want to show the following:
- Aquaculture production is increasing. 
- Sales per employee are decreasing. 
- Operation margins traditionally fluctuate and have been high since 2016, but are decreasing. 

How: These graphs are great examples of how to use data to make a point.
