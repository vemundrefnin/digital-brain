I will also use what I have learned from chapter 3 in the textbook to comment on the charts.\n\nBefore looking at the charts it is important to have a good understanding of the Gestalt principles. The Gestalt principles were developed in the 1900s. It is six principles of visual perceptions that describe how individuals perceive order in the world around them.\n\nThe first principle is _proximity_. It states that objects close to one another belong in the same group. As you can see in figure 3.1, we naturally see that the dots are in three different groups.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.jpg)\n\nThe second principle is _similarity_. We think similar objects belong in the same group. Object can be perceived as similar if they for example have the same color or the same shape as you can see in figure 3.3.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.jpg)\n\n_Enclosure_ is the third principle. This principle states that physically enclosed objects belong in the same group. As you can see in figure 3.5, _enclosure_ can be a type of box capturing several dots.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image003.jpg)\n\nThe next principle is _closure_. Several individual elements tend to be perceived as a single set. Therefore, we for example do not need a border around a line chart as you can see in figure 3.8.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.jpg)\n\nThe _continuity_ principle is fairly similar to the _closure_ principle. _Continuity_ states that we tend to fill in the blanks and the things we do not see. An example of this is displayed in figure 3.9. If we look at object set 1, we intuitively think that the result of pulling the objects apart will look like object set 2. But it could be the object set 3. This principle can be applied by for example removing unnecessary axis because our brain fills in the blanks, namely the axis.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image005.jpg)\n\nThe last principle is _connection_. This states that physically connected objects belong in the same group. Se figure 3.11 for an example of this.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image006.jpg)\n\nApart from the Gestalt principles chapter three also focus on the importance of eliminating clutter. The message will not come across if the cognitive load is too big. Therefore, it is important to minimize clutter. Clutter can be eliminated by the use of the Gestalt principles, but chapter three also states a few other ways of doing this.\n\nRotated text should be avoided to eliminate clutter. 45-degree rotated text is read 52% slower, 90-degree rotated text is read 205% slower. Chapter three also explains that the use of diagonal lines and centered text should be avoided to minimize clutter.\n\nThe most important thing of a chart is to show the data. By using high contrast colors on parts that do not highlight data will inflict an unnecessary cognitive load on the viewer. Chapter 3 says that this type of color use should be avoided but using contrasting colors in a well thought out manner can be a powerful tool to clearly mediate the message.\n\nThe Gestalt principles and the suggestions provided int chapter 3 can be used to improve already created charts. In the rest of this document, I will look at different charts and how they can be improved.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image007.jpg)\n\nThe Gestalt principle about closure suggests that it is unnecessary to have borders around a line chart. Having this closure (with the black or blue background color) can be interpreted as clutter. We want as little clutter as possible because more cluster will increase the cognitive load required from the reader. It is important to minimize the cognitive load to make the message we want to send be as clear as possible.\n\nIn my opinion the white background chart is preferable. Because it does not violate the _closure_ principle and the has an effective use of contrast to clearly mediate the data.\n\nMore context is needed to further evaluate these charts based on the Gestalt principles. The lack of context makes it impossible to understand whether the use of _connectivity_ makes sense. It is also difficult to understand if the _continuity_ principle can be applied here, making for example the y-axis obsolete.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image008.jpg)\n\nMy first impression is that this chart is cluttered. That is usually a clear sign that some of the Gestalt principles can be applied to improve the chart.\n\nI think the descriptions on the right side are unnecessary, despite that they satisfy the Gestalt principle about _similarity_ due to the color and _proximity_ due to the location. From the horizontal stacked bar chart, we can clearly see what the \"Survey Item A\" is the most \"Strongly Agree\" without the need of a description. Therefore, the descriptions make a clutter and should be removed to make the message clearer.\n\nBy applying the _continuity_ principle, I would get rid of the \"Percent of Total\" axis, because it inflicts unnecessary burden on the audience's cognitive load.\n\nThis chart uses the _similarity_ principle because \"Disagree | Natural | Agree\" are in the same color. _Enclosure_ is used because they are represented with same box in the stacked bar chart. This might be unnecessary clutter and should therefore be only one group instead of three. Unfortunately, the context and the intent of the chart is not available and they might suggest otherwise.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image009.jpg)\n\nThis chart is very similar to the previous, the only difference is the background and the colors.\n\nMy evaluation for the previous chart still holds for this chart as well.\n\nAdditionally for this chart the black background with the grey shadow inflicts unnecessary burden on the audience's cognitive load. At a minimum it should be changed to a solid color. It is important to remember that the chart is the most important thing and not the background color. Therefor as also mentioned in chapter 3, the use of contrasts should be limited to what is important, namely the data.\n\nThe colors and background for this chart is based on the firm‚Äôs theme. In my opinion this theme increases the cognitive load inflicted upon the viewer. Therefore, this boils down to the tradeoff question about whether the theme is most important or mediating the message in the clearest possible way.\n\n# Works Cited\n\nKnaflic, C. N.

You can understand the context by answering the following questions: \n- Who (To whom are you communicating?)\n- What (What do you want your audience to know?)\n- How (How can you use data to help make a point?)\n\nIt is also a good thing to answer the questions below to get a better understanding of the context. This is especially helpful if someone other than you is requesting the visualization.\n- What background information is relevant or essential?\n- Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know abut them?\n- What biases does our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant to our message?\n- What data is available that would strengthen our case? Is our audience familiar with this data, or is it new?\n- Where are the risks: what factors could weaken our case and do we need to proactively address them?\n- What would a successful outcome look like?\n- If you only had a limited amount of time or a single sentence to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say?\n\n## Example of Data Visualization Context\nI want to sell Donuts in Norway.\nWho: To potential investors.\nWhat: The popularity of donuts is increasing in Norway, please invest 1 million dollars.\nHow: The number of places to buy donuts in Norway is increasing.\n\nOda Bj√∏nnes Hanslien.

Private - The Github repo[^1] and the digital brain website is only accessible for me.\n2. Public - The Github repo and the digital brain website is public.\n3. Partly private - The Github repo is private but the digital brain website is public or partly public with some private notes.\n\nThese three options will be described in the next chapters.\n\n[^1]: Repo is short for repository. A repository is a place where code is stored. \n\nI have currently chosen option 3, partly private using the Quartz ignore approach.\n\n## Private\nThis is achieved with a private repo, but I am not sure how the website can be privet while still be available for me. Before it is even relevant to look into wether this is possible I have to understand why a private website would be preferable and if I need a website at all if it is private.\n\nI think the one of the reasons I want to have a private website is because it would make it accessible on any device at any time, everywhere. It will also have no privacy problems which i will discuss in the other chapters.\n\nBy making it private I loose the ability to simply update my website with the latest changes in the Quartz repo which my website is based on. This is due to the fact that I can not use a fork of Quartz. I will also not be able to simply share notes with other people. Additionally, they will not be able to add changes to the notes.\n\n| Pros              | Cons                 |\n| ----------------- | -------------------- |\n| No privacy issues | Not simple to update |\n| Accessibility     | Not shareable       | \n## Public\nTodo\n## Partly Private\nThe main reason for this alternative is to choose what should be private or not. The main concern is how the notes should be held private. The website itself must be public, but the repo can be public or private. There are some pros and cons for both. Read more about ignoring notes in [Quartz Ignoring Notes documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/ignore-notes/).\n\nIn a public repo you might think that every note is available for everyone. This is not true when `gitignore` is used. There are several pros and cons with this approach. \n\n| Pros                                                                        | Cons                                                                                                            |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Simple update due to the fact that a fork can be used                       | Might forget to add to gitignore, big hassle to fix if something is pushed                                      |\n| Only need to change gitignore and do not need to use quartz private feature | Difficult and scary to take everything down if I change my mind.

That way other people can be able to see everything in the repo, meaning all the notes. They can also change the notes. I can choose whether or not to add a lot of people or only the ones I greatly trust.

This model suggested unrealistic agent behavior when important characteristics of the industry were integrated. That is why this research paper looks into how firms learn in the period where the market is going form one equilibrium to another. It also investigates what is happening in this period, how long it lasts and suggests an improved model will indicate which equilibria are more likely to occur.\n\nThe research follow the electric market for FR (frequency response) in the united kingdom after deregulation. FR is used when shock to demand or supply occurs in the electric grid to keep it running.\n\nThe FR had previously used a fixed price until November 2005. Post-deregulation the firms submit bids and the research followed this  for six years. The research focus on 10 firms accounted for 85% of the market revenue. Each firm do not know what the other firms bid, but know their previous bids. The FR service can be regarded as identical between the firms because they use generators of same type and vintage.\n\nThe research looked at the average and individual bids of the firms and separated them into three periods.\n\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220907120108.png)\n\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220907120130.png)\n\n\nPeriod 1 has large changes in the average bid and each individual firm¬¥s bids. This research do not try to find a better model for the first period, but focus the analysis on period 2 and 3 to make an adaptive learning model that can outperform the Nash equilibrium. The analysis use the independent variables demand, the firms market position, previous bids from all firms and costs to determine the optimal next bid.\n\nThe following graph show the results of the analysis for period 2 and 3.\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220907144407.png)\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220907144413.png)\n\nIn the period 2 they describe their model compared to the Nash equilibrium model as following\n\n\tThe difference between these models and the equilibrium model was both economically and statistically significant.\n\nIn the third period both models perform well.\n\nIn my opinion this a very interesting and informative paper, but there are a few things I miss. I would like to see more than one example. The example with FR is great because a lot of other unwanted variables seems to be equal, but I would need more examples to be convinced. Especially since their suggested model only is better in a portion of the period they look at.\n\nThe other thing I miss is a better explanation of the graphs showing their results. The paper explains that they look at the difference between Nash Equilibrium and their model, but I do not think that is clearly shown in their graphs.","lastmodified":"2022-09-20T20:15:18.941907446Z","tags":null},"/SAS-LAB-7-Classification-Linear-Regression":{"title":"SAS LAB 7 - Classification Linear Regression","content":"# SAS LAB 7 - Classification Linear Regression\n\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220914194902.png)\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220914195156.png)\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220914195248.png)\n\nLinear regression equation: \n$y = 3.9 * height- 143.03$\n\nFor $p=0.05$ the result are statistically significant because it is greater than 0.0001 (model value given in table).

The second, $Y_{0,Khuzdar} ‚àí Y_{0,Maria}$, is the difference between the two students‚Äô health status were both to decide against insurance. This term, equal to ‚àí2, reflects Khuzdar‚Äôs relative frailty (weakness/easly sick). In the context of our effort to uncover causal effects, the lack of comparability captured by the second term is called **selection bias**.\n\nWe do the following to find the causal effect and selection bias for the average.\n$Y_i = Y_{0i} + \\kappa \u003c=\u003e  \\kappa = Y_i - Y_{0i}$\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220904163034.png)\n\nThis equation reveals that health comparisons between those with and without insurance equal the causal effect of interest ($\\kappa$) plus the difference in average $Y_{0i}$ between the insured and the uninsured. As in the parable of Khuzdar and Maria, this second term describes selection bias. Specifically, the difference in average health by insurance status can be written:\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220904163351.png)\n\nTo fix the selection bias we strive to make [[ceteris paribus]]. This is done by finding the sources of selection bias, such as education. This bias is eliminated by focusing on samples of people with the same schooling, say, college graduates. \n\nThe selection bias is eliminated in [[randomized trials]].\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-20T20:15:18.941907446Z","tags":null},"/Show-Me-the-Numbers-Book-notes":{"title":"Show Me the Numbers - Book notes","content":"# Show Me the Numbers - Book Notes\nA book about how to best display numbers. This is closely related to #visual-analytics #cis5250.\n\nThe following notes are only things i found most important from each chapter.\n\n## 1. Introduction\nCategorical bar charts should/can be changed to multiple line charts.\nPiecharts to horizontal bar charts.\n\nReal purpose of quantitative displays: *to provide the reader with important, meaningful, and useful insight*. To communicate quantitative information effectively requires an understanding of the numbers and the ability to display their message for accurate and efficient interpretation by the reader.\n\n\tThe overwhelming fact of data graphics is that they stand of fall on their content, gracfully displayed. Above all else show the data.\n\n\tIf the statistics are boring, then you¬¥ve got the wrong numbers.\n\n-[[Edward Tufte]]\n\n## 3. Differing Roles of Tables and Graphs\nNo graph or table needed for very little data. Can be explained in a sentence. For example: \n**Q2 Sales = $1,400,000, exceeding forecast by 16%**\n\nBut it could be structured in a tabular form such as this:\n\n| Q2 Sales   | Compared to Forecast |\n| ---------- | --------------------:|\n| $1,400,000 |                 +16% |\nor this:\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eQ2 Sales \u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e$1,400,000\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eCompared to Forecast\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e+16%\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\nChoosing whether to display data in one or mare tables, one ore more graph or some combination fo the two, is  a fundamental challenge of data presentation. This decision should never be arbitrary.\n\nUse a table if one or more of the following is true:\n1. The display will be used to look up individual values.\n2. It will be used to compare individual values but not entire series of values to one another\n3. Precise values are required.\n4. The quantitative information to be communicated involves more than one unit of measure.\n5. Both summary and detail values are included.\n\nA question I can think of when reading this is: \n\"Since the improvement of interactive data visualization do the old theory about graph and table still hold.\"","lastmodified":"2022-09-20T20:15:18.941907446Z","tags":null},"/Sir-Ronald-Aylmer-Fisher":{"title":"Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher","content":"# Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher\nLived in the beginning of the twentieth century.\n- 1929 *statistical Methods for Research Workers*\n- 1935 * The Design of Experiments*\n\ninvented the method of maximum likelihood. \n\n# Related\n[Control Group](ECON5100%20-%20Seminar%20Applied%20Microeconomic%20Analysis/Control%20Group.md)\n[randomized trials](randomized%20trials.md)\n[Selection Bias](Selection%20Bias.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-20T20:15:18.941907446Z","tags":null},"/Starte-kontakt-med-landbaserte-anlegg":{"title":"Starte kontakt med landbaserte anlegg","content":"# Starte kontakt med landbaserte anlegg\n10. juni var jeg p√• m√∏te med Blue Planet. \n[[Eivind Helland]] og [[Ragnar Tveteraas]] var p√• m√∏tet.\n\nDe er villig til √• inng√• i et samarbeid rundt masteroppgaven.\nFor √• komme finne ut en relevant problemstilling ble vi enig om gj√∏re litt research hos noen av anleggene.
