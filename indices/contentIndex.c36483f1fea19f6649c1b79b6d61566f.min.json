I will also use what I have learned from chapter 3 in the textbook to comment on the charts.\n\nBefore looking at the charts it is important to have a good understanding of the Gestalt principles. The Gestalt principles were developed in the 1900s. It is six principles of visual perceptions that describe how individuals perceive order in the world around them.\n\nThe first principle is _proximity_. It states that objects close to one another belong in the same group. As you can see in figure 3.1, we naturally see that the dots are in three different groups.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.jpg)\n\nThe second principle is _similarity_. We think similar objects belong in the same group. Object can be perceived as similar if they for example have the same color or the same shape as you can see in figure 3.3.\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220920132706.png)\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.jpg)\n\n_Enclosure_ is the third principle. This principle states that physically enclosed objects belong in the same group. As you can see in figure 3.5, _enclosure_ can be a type of box capturing several dots.\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220920132734.png)\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image003.jpg)\n\nThe next principle is _closure_. Several individual elements tend to be perceived as a single set. Therefore, we for example do not need a border around a line chart as you can see in figure 3.8.\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220920132746.png)\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.jpg)\n\nThe _continuity_ principle is fairly similar to the _closure_ principle. _Continuity_ states that we tend to fill in the blanks and the things we do not see. An example of this is displayed in figure 3.9. If we look at object set 1, we intuitively think that the result of pulling the objects apart will look like object set 2. But it could be the object set 3. This principle can be applied by for example removing unnecessary axis because our brain fills in the blanks, namely the axis.\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220920132753.png)\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image005.jpg)\n\nThe last principle is _connection_. This states that physically connected objects belong in the same group. Se figure 3.11 for an example of this.\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220920132759.png)\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image006.jpg)\n\nApart from the Gestalt principles chapter three also focus on the importance of eliminating clutter. The message will not come across if the cognitive load is too big. Therefore, it is important to minimize clutter. Clutter can be eliminated by the use of the Gestalt principles, but chapter three also states a few other ways of doing this.\n\nRotated text should be avoided to eliminate clutter. 45-degree rotated text is read 52% slower, 90-degree rotated text is read 205% slower. Chapter three also explains that the use of diagonal lines and centered text should be avoided to minimize clutter.\n\nThe most important thing of a chart is to show the data. By using high contrast colors on parts that do not highlight data will inflict an unnecessary cognitive load on the viewer. Chapter 3 says that this type of color use should be avoided but using contrasting colors in a well thought out manner can be a powerful tool to clearly mediate the message.\n\nThe Gestalt principles and the suggestions provided int chapter 3 can be used to improve already created charts. In the rest of this document, I will look at different charts and how they can be improved.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image007.jpg)\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220920132818.png)\nThe Gestalt principle about closure suggests that it is unnecessary to have borders around a line chart. Having this closure (with the black or blue background color) can be interpreted as clutter. We want as little clutter as possible because more cluster will increase the cognitive load required from the reader. It is important to minimize the cognitive load to make the message we want to send be as clear as possible.\n\nIn my opinion the white background chart is preferable. Because it does not violate the _closure_ principle and the has an effective use of contrast to clearly mediate the data.\n\nMore context is needed to further evaluate these charts based on the Gestalt principles. The lack of context makes it impossible to understand whether the use of _connectivity_ makes sense. It is also difficult to understand if the _continuity_ principle can be applied here, making for example the y-axis obsolete.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image008.jpg)\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220920132830.png)\nMy first impression is that this chart is cluttered. That is usually a clear sign that some of the Gestalt principles can be applied to improve the chart.\n\nI think the descriptions on the right side are unnecessary, despite that they satisfy the Gestalt principle about _similarity_ due to the color and _proximity_ due to the location. From the horizontal stacked bar chart, we can clearly see what the \"Survey Item A\" is the most \"Strongly Agree\" without the need of a description. Therefore, the descriptions make a clutter and should be removed to make the message clearer.\n\nBy applying the _continuity_ principle, I would get rid of the \"Percent of Total\" axis, because it inflicts unnecessary burden on the audience's cognitive load.\n\nThis chart uses the _similarity_ principle because \"Disagree | Natural | Agree\" are in the same color. _Enclosure_ is used because they are represented with same box in the stacked bar chart. This might be unnecessary clutter and should therefore be only one group instead of three. Unfortunately, the context and the intent of the chart is not available and they might suggest otherwise.\n\n![](file:////Users/vemundrefnin/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image009.jpg)\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220920132839.png)\nThis chart is very similar to the previous, the only difference is the background and the colors.\n\nMy evaluation for the previous chart still holds for this chart as well.\n\nAdditionally for this chart the black background with the grey shadow inflicts unnecessary burden on the audience's cognitive load. At a minimum it should be changed to a solid color. It is important to remember that the chart is the most important thing and not the background color. Therefor as also mentioned in chapter 3, the use of contrasts should be limited to what is important, namely the data.\n\nThe colors and background for this chart is based on the firm’s theme. In my opinion this theme increases the cognitive load inflicted upon the viewer. Therefore, this boils down to the tradeoff question about whether the theme is most important or mediating the message in the clearest possible way.\n\n# Works Cited\n\nKnaflic, C. N.

Does the theoretical analysis make sense?\n2. Are the data used adequate to the task?\n3. Does the empirical methodology adequately?\n4. Are the assumptions reasonable?\n5.

You can understand the context by answering the following questions:\n- Who (To whom are you communicating?)\n- What (What do you want your audience to know?)\n- How (How can you use data to help make a point?)\n\nIt is also a good thing to answer the questions below to get a better understanding of the context. This is especially helpful if someone other than you is requesting the visualization.\n- What background information is relevant or essential?\n- Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know abut them?\n- What biases does our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant to our message?\n- What data is available that would strengthen our case? Is our audience familiar with this data, or is it new?\n- Where are the risks: what factors could weaken our case and do we need to proactively address them?\n- What would a successful outcome look like?\n- If you only had a limited amount of time or a single sentence to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say?\n\n## Example of Data Visualization Context\nI want to sell Donuts in Norway.\nWho: To potential investors.\nWhat: The popularity of donuts is increasing in Norway, please invest 1 million dollars.\nHow: The number of places to buy donuts in Norway is increasing.\n\nOda Bjønnes Hanslien.

Vi har begge gått bachelor i dataingeniør og har flere års erfaring fra IT-bransjen. Jeg (Vemund) skrev bacheloroppgave i samarbeid med Tytlandsvik Aqua i 2021. Nå har vi startet med masteroppgaven med rådgivning av Blue Planet og skal leveres juni 2023. Se vedlegg for mer informasjon om oss og bacheloroppgaven. \n\nVi har lyst til å bruke vår tid og erfaring på å hjelpe fiskeoppdrettsnæringen, altså dere, så mye som mulig. Får å gjøre dette på en mest effektiv måte trenger vi vite litt mer om hvordan dere drive oppdrett. Vi har også veldig lyst til å komme på besøk til dere for å fortelle litt om oss og våre planer i tillegg til å møte dere og se hvordan dere driver oppdrett. Vi har noen spørsmål hvor deres svar vil påvirke hvordan vi jobber de neste 9 månedene. Spørsmålene er i slutten av denne mailen, vi setter veldig pris på om dere kan svare med en mail eller om vi tar det når vi eventuelt besøker dere.\n\nVi har forstått at fiskeoppdrett er en \"Lean\" næring og har derfor kanskje ikke mye ledig tid til å svare på denne mailen. Vi tenker å ringe dere om en måned dersom dere ikke har hatt tid til å svare, håper det går fint.\n\nHvis dere ønsker å holde svarene konfidensielle så skriver vi gjerne under på en fortrolighetsavtale (NDA).\n\n**Spørsmål:**\n1. Hva er deres største kostnader? Helst kom med minst 4 kostnader.\n2. Hvilke kostnader har størst forbedringspotensial? (Trenger ikke være en av de beskrevet i spørsmål 1.)\n3. Beskriv deres inntektskilder?\n4. Har dere noen tanker rundt hvordan øke inntekten fra de kildene eller hvordan skape ny inntektskilder?\n5. Hva er deres 5 største utfordringer?\n\n**Vedlegg**\n1.

The underlying assumption is that stocks with high expected returns ex ante will deliver high realized returns ex post. Rather than taking the “detour” to estimate stock-level expected returns, we take an alternative approach here. In particular, we use a support vector machine to directly classify stocks into decile portfolios based on linear combinations of predictor variables.\n\n\tFinally, we compare the performance of traditional expected return-based portfolio formation with a classification-based approach. In particular, we contrast neural networks (which outperform all other traditional approaches in our empirical analysis) with support vector machines (SVMs). The idea behind SVMs is to search for hyperplanes that territorially divide a multidimensional vector space (our sample of firm observations, consisting of stock-level predictors and decile portfolio labels) into groups of vectors that belong to the same class. This allows for the classification of stocks into decile portfolios without taking the “detour” to predict stock-level expected returns. We find that the classification-based approach is superior to even the best-performing expected return-based portfolio formation because it avoids some of the noise in stock-level returns. Most importantly, it is able to maintain the broad return signal, which is essential for our trading strategy, i.e., the correct classification into a decile portfolio.","lastmodified":"2022-10-22T07:06:04.772584356Z","tags":null},"/My-Emails":{"title":"","content":"# My Emails\n\n## vemund@refnin.no\nForwarded to my gmail.

What question is the author asking?\nHow do capable are different machine learning methods to measuring asset risk premia?\nMore concretely \"predicting returns in the cross section and time series\"\n\n3. What answer does the author propose (i.e., what is the principle assertion of the study)?\nLarge economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts.\n\n5. In what ways does the study improve upon previous research?\nRecently, variations of machine learning methods have been used to study the cross section of stock returns. Harvey and Liu (2016) study the multiple comparisons problem using a bootstrap procedure. Giglio and Xiu (2016) and Kelly et al. (2019) use dimension reduction methods to estimate and test factor pricing models. Moritz and Zimmermann (2016) apply tree-based models to portfolio sorting. Kozak et al. (2019) and Freyberger et al. (2019) use shrinkage and selection methods to, respectively, approximate a stochastic discount factor and a nonlinear function for expected returns.\n\n7. How does this the proposed answer compare with that provided by previous research?\n\n9. What are the major logic or theoretical reasons for the author´s argument?\n\n11. What emperical evidence does the author provide?\n\n13. What assumptions is the author making his or her reasoning?\n\n## Evaluating the Author´s Argument\n1. Does the theoretical analysis make sense?\n2. Are the data used adequate to the task?\n3. Does the empirical methodology adequately?\n4. Are the assumptions reasonable?\n5. Is the analysis (theoretical and empirical) clearly explained?\n6. Do the conclusions follow from the evidence presented?\n7. On balance, is the author´s argument convincing to you?\n\n## Review Papers Content\n- What is the main research question\n- Method and data\n\t- What data is used\n\t- how many years\n\t- how to clean data and collect it\n- Dependent variables\n- Independent variables\n- What is done right or wrong, recommendation for improvement\n\n# Notes From Paper\nMachine learning Methods: linear regression, generalized linear models with penalization, dimension reduction via principal components regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS), regression trees (including boosted trees and random forests), and neural networks.\n\n## Data\nWe conduct a large scale empirical analysis, investigating nearly 30,000 individual stocks over 60 years from 1957 to 2016.\nPredictor set includes 94 characteristics for each stock, interactions of each characteristic with eight aggregate time series variables, and 74 industry sector dummy variables, totaling more than 900 baseline signals.\n\nThe immediate implication is that machine learning aids in solving practical investments problems such as market timing, portfolio choice, and risk management, justifying its role in the business architecture of the fintech industry.\n\n## Controlgroup (?)\nConsider as a benchmark a panel regression of individual stock returns onto three lagged stocklevel characteristics: size, book-to-market, and momentum.\nLewellen (2015) demonstrates that this model performs about as well as larger and more complex stock prediction models studied in the literature.\nR2 from the benchmark model is 0.16% per month for the panel of individual stock returns.\nAlso controllgroup:\n\n\tOur work extends the empirical literature on stock return prediction, which comes in two basic strands. The first strand models differences in expected returns across stocks as a function of stocklevel characteristics, and is exemplified by Fama and French (2008) and Lewellen (2015). The typical approach in this literature runs cross-sectional regressions of future stock returns on a few lagged stock characteristics. The second strand forecasts the time series of returns and is surveyed by Koijen and Nieuwerburgh (2011) and Rapach and Zhou (2013). This literature typically conducts time series regressions of broad aggregate portfolio returns on a small number of macroeconomic predictor variables.\n\n## Findings\n1. Machine learning shows great promise for empirical asset pricing.\n   R2 into positive territory at 0.11% per month\n\n2. Vast predictor sets are viable for linear prediction when either penalization or dimension reduction is used.\n   R2 into positive territory at 0.11% per month. Principal components regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS), which reduce the dimension of the predictor set to a few linear combinations of predictors, further raise the out-of-sample R2 to 0.26% and 0.27%, respectively.\n\n4. Allowing for nonlinearities substantially improves predictions.\n   Accived with generalized linear models, regression trees, and neural networks.\n   monthly stock-level R2 ’s between 0.33% and 0.40%.\n\n5. Shallow learning outperforms deeper learning.\n\tneural network performance peaks at three hidden layers then declines as more layers are added. Likewise, the boosted tree and random forest algorithms tend to select trees with few “leaves” (on average less than six leaves) in our analysis.\n\n6. The distance between nonlinear methods and the benchmark widens when predicting portfolio returns.\n   By aggregating stock-level forecasts from the benchmark three-characteristic OLS model, we find a monthly S\u0026P 500 predictive R2 of −0.22%. The bottom-up S\u0026P 500 forecast from the generalized linear model, in contrast, delivers an R2 of 0.71%. Trees and neural networks improve upon this further, generating monthly out-of-sample R2 ’s between 1.08% to 1.80% per month.\n\n7. The economic gains from machine learning forecasts are large.\n   Our tests show clear statistical rejections of the OLS benchmark and other linear models in favor of nonlinear machine learning tools.\n\n8. The most successful predictors are price trends, liquidity, and volatility\n\n9. Better understanding our machine learning findings through simulation.\nWhen we apply our machine learning repertoire to the simulated datasets, we find that linear and generalized linear methods dominate in the linear and uninteracted setting, yet tree-based methods and neural networks significantly outperform in the nonlinear and interactive setting.\n\n## Method:\nThey compare thirteen models in total, including OLS with all covariates, OLS-3 (which pre-selects size, book-to-market, and momentum as the only covariates), PLS, PCR, elastic net (ENet), generalized linear model with group lasso (GLM), random forest (RF), gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT), and neural network architectures with one to five layers (NN1,…,NN5). For OLS, ENet, GLM, and GBRT, we present their robust versions using Huber loss, which perform better than the version without.\n\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220929174854.png)\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220929175330.png)\nThe comparative performance across different methods is similar to the monthly results shown in Table 1, but the annual R2 oos is nearly an order of magnitude larger. Their success in forecasting annual returns likewise illustrates that\nmachine learning models are able to isolate risk premia that persist over business cycle frequencies and are not merely capturing short-lived inefficiencies.\n\nFigures 4 and 5 demonstrate that models are generally in close agreement regarding the most influential stock-level predictors, which can be grouped into four categories.\n\nThe first are based on recent price trends, including five of the top seven variables in Figure 5: short-term reversal (mom1m), stock momentum (mom12m), momentum change (chmom), industry momentum (indmom), recent maximum return (maxret), and long-term reversal (mom36m).\n\nNext are liquidity variables, including turnover and turnover volatility (turn, std turn), log market equity (mvel1), dollar volume (dolvol), Amihud illiquidity (ill), number of zero trading days (zerotrade), and bidask spread (baspread).\n\nRisk measures constitute the third influential group, including total and idiosyncratic return volatility (retvol, idiovol), market beta (beta), and beta-squared (betasq).\n\nThe last group includes valuation ratios and fundamental signals, such as earnings-to-price (ep), sales-toprice (sp), asset growth (agr), and number of recent earnings increases (nincr). Figure 4 shows that characteristic importance magnitudes for penalized linear models and dimension reduction models are highly skewed toward momentum and reversal. Trees and neural networks are more democratic, drawing predictive information from a broader set of characteristics.\n\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220929181507.png)\nWe also construct eight macroeconomic predictors following the variable definitions detailed in Welch and Goyal (2008), including dividend-price ratio (dp), earnings-price ratio (ep), book-tomarket ratio (bm), net equity expansion (ntis), Treasury-bill rate (tbl), term spread (tms), default spread (dfy), and stock variance (svar).3\n\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220929182206.png)\nAll models agree that the aggregate book-to-market ratio is a critical predictor, whereas market volatility has little role in any model.\n\n## Machine Poritfolio\nThe best 10–1 strategy comes from NN4, which returns on average 2.3% per month (27.1% on an annualized basis). Its monthly volatility is 5.8% (20.1% annualized), amounting to an annualized out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of 1.35\n\n### Simple Linear\nThe baseline estimation of the simple linear model uses a standard least squares, or “l2”, objective function\n$$L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{NT}\\sum^{N}_{i=1}\\sum^{T}_{t=1}(r_{i,t+1}-g(z_{i,t};\\theta))^2$$\n#### Extension - Robust Objective Function\nCan somtimes improve predictive performance by replacing equation (4) with a weighted least squares objective such as\n$$L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{NT}\\sum^{N}_{i=1}\\sum^{T}_{t=1}w_{i,t}(r_{i,t+1}-g(z_{i,t};\\theta))^2$$\n\nIn the machine learning literature, a common choice for counteracting the deleterious effect of heavy-tailed observations is the Huber robust objective function, defined as\n\n$$L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{NT}\\sum^{N}_{i=1}\\sum^{T}_{t=1}H(r_{i,t+1}-g(z_{i,t};\\theta), \\xi)$$\nwhere\n$$\nH(x;\\xi) =\n\\Big\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\tx^{2}, \\text{ if } |x|\\leq \\xi;\\\\\n\t2\\xi |x|-\\xi^2, text{ if } |x|\\geq \\xi.\\\\\n\\end{matrix}\n$$\nThe Huber loss, H(·), is a hybrid of squared loss for relatively small errors and absolute loss for relatively large errors, where the combination is controlled by a tuning parameter, ξ, that can be optimized adaptively from the data.\nIn the empirical analysis they study the predictive benefits of robust loss functions in multiple machine learning methods.\n\n### Penalized Linear\nWhen the number of predictors P approaches the number of observations T, the linear model becomes inefficient or even inconsistent.\n\nPenalized methods differ by appending a penalty to the original loss function\n$$L(θ; ·) =L(θ) + φ(θ; ·)$$\nThere are several choices for the penalty function φ(θ; ·). We focus on the popular “elastic net” penalty, which takes the form\n$$\\Phi(\\theta; \\lambda; p) = \\lambda(1-p)\\sum^{P}_{j=1}|\\theta_j|+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda p \\sum^{P}_{j=1}\\theta^2_{j}$$\nThey adaptively optimize the tuning parameters, λ and ρ, using the validation sample. Our implementation of penalized regression uses the accelerated proximal gradient algorithm and accommodates both least squares and Huber objective functions.\n\n### Dimension Reduction: PCR and PL\n…\n### Generalized Linear\nThey first and most straightforward nonparametric approach that they consider is the generalized linear model. It introduces nonlinear transformations of the original predictors as new additive terms in an otherwise linear model. Generalized linear models are thus the closest nonlinear counterparts to the linear approaches.\n\nForecasting with the generalized linear model can be approached with the same estimation tools as in \"Simple Linear\". In particular, our analysis uses a least squares objective function, both with and without the Huber robustness modification. Because series expansion quickly multiplies the number of model parameters, we use penalization to control degrees of freedom.\n\n### Boosted Regression Trees and Random Forest\nUnlike linear models, trees are fully nonparametric and possess a logic that departs markedly from traditional regressions.\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220929171900.png)\n\nUsed boosting and random forest.\n\n### Neural Networks\nThey are the currently preferred approach for complex machine learning problems such as computer vision, natural language processing, and automated game-playing.\n- traditional “feed-forward” networks.\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220929173026.png)\nThere are many potential choices for the nonlinear activation function (such as sigmoid, hyperbolic, softmax, etc.). We use the same activation function at all nodes, and choose a popular functional form in recent literature known as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), defined as\n\n$$ReLU(x) =\n\\Big\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\t0, \\text{ if } |x|\\leq 0\\\\\n\tx, \\text{ otherwise}\\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nwhich encourages sparsity in the number of active neurons, and allows for faster derivative evaluation.\n\nIn addition to l1 penalization of the weight parameters, we simultaneously employ four other regularization techniques in our estimation: learning rate shrinkage, early stopping, batch normalization, and ensembles\n## Critiques\n- Are they qualified?\n- is the model overfitted?\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220929172723.png)\n- Difficult to trust because it is difficult to understand.\n- Different controllgroup","lastmodified":"2022-10-22T07:06:04.772584356Z","tags":null},"/Overview-of-Review-Empirical-asset-pricing-via-machine-learning-evidence-from-the-European-stock-market":{"title":"Overview of Review - Empirical asset pricing via machine learning evidence from the European stock market","content":"# Overview of Review - Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning Evidence From the European Stock Market\n\n[paper link](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/s41260-021-00237-x.pdf)\n\n[[Review - Empirical asset pricing via machine learning evidence from the European stock market]]\n\nDrobetz:\n\n# Main Question\n\nUse machine learning methods to predict returns in European stocks.\n\n## Control Group\nIn our empirical analysis, we exploit a set of twenty-two\npredictors as per the linear FM regressions approach used in\nDrobetz et al.

Ensemble models including Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and deep learning, in particular Multi-Layer Perceptions (MLP) have all been used to provide data-driven predictions after initial feature engineering. These three regression-based machine learning (ML) models are used to predict the container shipping rates in the North American TransBorder Freight dataset from 2006 to 2021. It has been found that MLP surpasses ensemble models with a test accuracy rate of 97%. Although our findings are drawn from American shipping data, the proposed approach serves as a general method for other international markets.\n\n# Words\n- ultra-large container ships (ULCS)\n- Random Forest (RF)\n- machine learning (ML)\n- Multi-Layer Perceptions (MLP)\n- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)\n- Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)\n- mean squared error (MSE)\n- mean absolute error (MAE)\n- root mean squared error (RMSE)\n\n# Comments\nI think i like that they are explaining overall level of information\n\n# Critics\nFigures are not nice and are lacking text.\nIs USA included or is it only Canada and Mexico.\nNoticed that this had some small deatials missing.

Read more about ignoring notes in [Quartz Ignoring Notes documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/ignore-notes/).\n\nIn a public repo you might think that every note is available for everyone. This is not true when `gitignore` is used.

The research argue that human capital embodied in founders or early joiners are very important for the growth of the firm. This is done by looking at a natural experiment, comparing deaths of founders and early joiners to deaths of later joiners. Founders and early joiners is herby referred to as \"founding team\".\n\nThey look at all American nonfarm startups between 1990 and 2015 which includes 25000 startups.

The main question this paper try to answer is how capable different machine learning methods are to measure asset risk premia.\n\nThere are many different machine learning methods, but this paper focus on a few which the researchers argue is the most relevant based on other research. They refer to a lot of other research throughout the whole paper where they do not explicitly discuss their reasoning. The researchers compare thirteen models in total, which are OLS with all covariates, OLS-3 with pre-selected size, book-to-market and momentum, PLS, PCR, elastic net, generalized linear model with group lasso, random forest, gradient boosted regression trees, and neural network architectures with one to five layers.\n\nThe data set used consist of all firms listed on AMEX, NASDAQ and NYSE with samples from 1957 to 2016 with a total of 30,000 stocks.\nAll methods use covariate from the same set of features. This set of features consist of 94 stock-level predictive characteristics, 74 industry dummies, and 8 macro predictors. The data from 1957 to 2016 are divided into three groups, 18 years of training sample, 12 years of validation sample, and the remaining 30 years for out-of-sample testing.\n\nTo measure the results for the machine learning methods they need to compare the results to something well known. In many out-of-sample forecasting applications, predictions are compared against historical mean returns. This has some flaws that is avoid by benchmarking $R^2$ against a forecast value of zero. $R^2$ is used to evaluate the performance of each method.\n$$R^2_{oos}=1-\\frac{\\sum_{(i,t\\in \\tau_3)}{(r_{i,t+1}-\\hat{r}_{i,t+1})^2}}{\\sum_{(i,t\\in \\tau_3)}r^2_{i,t+1}}$$\nwhere $\\tau_3$ indicates the out-of-sample testing data, $r_{i,t+1}$ is an asset’s return in excess of the risk-free rate and d $\\hat{r}_{i,t+1}$ denote the fitted model and its ensuing return forecast. This $R^2_{oos}$ is used in a Diebold-Mariano test to determine whether the two forecasts are significantly different.\n\nAfter performing the comparisons between all the methods they have multiple conclusions, here are the ones I think is the most important\n1. \"Machine learning shows great promise for empirical asset pricing. R2 into positive territory at 0.11% per month.\"\n2. \"Vast predictor sets are viable for linear prediction when either penalization or dimension reduction is used\"\n3. \"Allowing for nonlinearities substantially improves predictions\"\n4. \"Shallow learning outperforms deeper learning\"\n5. \"The distance between nonlinear methods and the benchmark widens when predicting portfolio 5 returns.\"\n6. \"The economic gains from machine learning forecasts are large.\"\n7. \"The most successful predictors are price trends, liquidity, and volatility.\"\n\nI think the findings of this paper is very interesting. In my opinion the credibility of this research are weakened by the share complexity of both machine learning and the stock market. The credibility might be improved if I read all the referenced material and appendixes. That might also strengthen the connection between their findings and the results for the methods they are representing, which is not very intuitive to understand just form reading the paper.","lastmodified":"2022-10-22T07:06:04.772584356Z","tags":null},"/Review-Empirical-asset-pricing-via-machine-learning-evidence-from-the-European-stock-market":{"title":"Review - Empirical asset pricing via machine learning evidence from the European stock market","content":"Drobetz: Use machine learning methods to predict returns in European stocks.\n\nThis paper was published in the \"Journal of Asset Management\"in 2021 and can be seen as an extension to another paper \"[Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning](Review%20-%20Empirical%20Asset%20Pricing%20via%20Machine%20Learning.md)\" written by Shihao Gu with others.

This model suggested unrealistic agent behavior when important characteristics of the industry were integrated. That is why this research paper looks into how firms learn in the period where the market is going form one equilibrium to another. It also investigates what is happening in this period, how long it lasts and suggests an improved model will indicate which equilibria are more likely to occur.\n\nThe research follow the electric market for FR (frequency response) in the united kingdom after deregulation. FR is used when shock to demand or supply occurs in the electric grid to keep it running.\n\nThe FR had previously used a fixed price until November 2005. Post-deregulation the firms submit bids and the research followed this for six years. The research focus on 10 firms accounted for 85% of the market revenue. Each firm do not know what the other firms bid, but know their previous bids. The FR service can be regarded as identical between the firms because they use generators of same type and vintage.\n\nThe research looked at the average and individual bids of the firms and separated them into three periods.\n\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220907120108.png)\n\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220907120130.png)\n\nPeriod 1 has large changes in the average bid and each individual firm´s bids. This research do not try to find a better model for the first period, but focus the analysis on period 2 and 3 to make an adaptive learning model that can outperform the Nash equilibrium. The analysis use the independent variables demand, the firms market position, previous bids from all firms and costs to determine the optimal next bid.\n\nThe following graph show the results of the analysis for period 2 and 3.\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220907144407.png)\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220907144413.png)\n\nIn the period 2 they describe their model compared to the Nash equilibrium model as following\n\n\tThe difference between these models and the equilibrium model was both economically and statistically significant.\n\nIn the third period both models perform well.\n\nIn my opinion this a very interesting and informative paper, but there are a few things I miss. I would like to see more than one example. The example with FR is great because a lot of other unwanted variables seems to be equal, but I would need more examples to be convinced. Especially since their suggested model only is better in a portion of the period they look at.\n\nThe other thing I miss is a better explanation of the graphs showing their results. The paper explains that they look at the difference between Nash Equilibrium and their model, but I do not think that is clearly shown in their graphs.","lastmodified":"2022-10-22T07:06:04.772584356Z","tags":null},"/Review-Paper-Guide":{"title":"Review Paper Guide","content":" - What is the main research question\n- Method and data\n\t- What data is used\n\t- how many years\n\t- how to clean data and collect it\n- Dependent variables\n- Independent variables\n- What is done right or wrong, recommendation for improvement\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-22T07:06:04.772584356Z","tags":null},"/Review-Regression-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning-Approaches-for-Predicting-Container-Shipping-Rates":{"title":"Review - Regression Analysis Using Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Container Shipping Rates","content":"\nKhan: Finding the best machine learning method to predicting shipping container freight rates.\n\nThis paper was written by Ibraheem Abdulhafiz Khan a research student in the field of Artificial Intelligence and his colleague Farookh Khadeer Hussain.

In the context of our effort to uncover causal effects, the lack of comparability captured by the second term is called **selection bias**.\n\nWe do the following to find the causal effect and selection bias for the average.\n$Y_i = Y_{0i} + \\kappa \u003c=\u003e \\kappa = Y_i - Y_{0i}$\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220904163034.png)\n\nThis equation reveals that health comparisons between those with and without insurance equal the causal effect of interest ($\\kappa$) plus the difference in average $Y_{0i}$ between the insured and the uninsured. As in the parable of Khuzdar and Maria, this second term describes selection bias. Specifically, the difference in average health by insurance status can be written:\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220904163351.png)\n\nTo fix the selection bias we strive to make [[ceteris paribus]]. This is done by finding the sources of selection bias, such as education. This bias is eliminated by focusing on samples of people with the same schooling, say, college graduates.\n\nThe selection bias is eliminated in [[randomized trials]].\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-22T07:06:04.772584356Z","tags":null},"/Show-Me-the-Numbers-Book-notes":{"title":"Show Me the Numbers - Book notes","content":"# Show Me the Numbers - Book Notes\nA book about how to best display numbers. This is closely related to #visual-analytics #cis5250.\n\nThe following notes are only things i found most important from each chapter.\n\n## 1. Introduction\nCategorical bar charts should/can be changed to multiple line charts.\nPiecharts to horizontal bar charts.\n\nReal purpose of quantitative displays: *to provide the reader with important, meaningful, and useful insight*. To communicate quantitative information effectively requires an understanding of the numbers and the ability to display their message for accurate and efficient interpretation by the reader.\n\n\tThe overwhelming fact of data graphics is that they stand of fall on their content, gracfully displayed. Above all else show the data.\n\n\tIf the statistics are boring, then you´ve got the wrong numbers.\n\n-[[Edward Tufte]]\n\n## 3. Differing Roles of Tables and Graphs\nNo graph or table needed for very little data. Can be explained in a sentence. For example:\n**Q2 Sales = $1,400,000, exceeding forecast by 16%**\n\nBut it could be structured in a tabular form such as this:\n\n| Q2 Sales   | Compared to Forecast |\n| ---------- | --------------------:|\n| $1,400,000 |                 +16% |\nor this:\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eQ2 Sales \u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e$1,400,000\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eCompared to Forecast\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e+16%\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\nChoosing whether to display data in one or mare tables, one ore more graph or some combination fo the two, is a fundamental challenge of data presentation. This decision should never be arbitrary.\n\nUse a table if one or more of the following is true:\n1. The display will be used to look up individual values.\n2. It will be used to compare individual values but not entire series of values to one another\n3. Precise values are required.\n4. The quantitative information to be communicated involves more than one unit of measure.\n5. Both summary and detail values are included.\n\nA question I can think of when reading this is:\n\"Since the improvement of interactive data visualization do the old theory about graph and table still hold.\"","lastmodified":"2022-10-22T07:06:04.772584356Z","tags":null},"/Sir-Ronald-Aylmer-Fisher":{"title":"Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher","content":"# Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher\nLived in the beginning of the twentieth century.\n- 1929 *statistical Methods for Research Workers*\n- 1935 * The Design of Experiments*\n\ninvented the method of maximum likelihood.\n\n# Related\n[Control Group](ECON5100%20-%20Seminar%20Applied%20Microeconomic%20Analysis/Control%20Group.md)\n[randomized trials](randomized%20trials.md)\n[Selection Bias](Selection%20Bias.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-22T07:06:04.772584356Z","tags":null},"/Starte-kontakt-med-landbaserte-anlegg":{"title":"Starte kontakt med landbaserte anlegg","content":"# Starte Kontakt Med Landbaserte Anlegg\n10. juni var jeg på møte med Blue Planet.\n[[Eivind Helland]] og [[Ragnar Tveteraas]] var på møtet.\n\nDe er villig til å inngå i et samarbeid rundt masteroppgaven.\nFor å komme finne ut en relevant problemstilling ble vi enig om gjøre litt research hos noen av anleggene.

This is what we call selection bias.\n\n$$\n\\text{potential violence=}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nV_{1i} \\text{, if } D_{i}=1\\\\\nV_{0i} \\text{, if } D_{i}=0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\delta=V_{1i}-V_{0i}\n$$\nIn practice we are after\n$$E(\\delta) = e(V_{1i})-E(V_{0i})$$\n\nWe can separately look at each states that got the policy implemented.\n$$D_i=1, V_{1i}-V_{0i}, \\text{where } V_{0i} \\text{ is the observer and } V_{1i} \\text{ is the counterfactual}$$\n$$D_i=0, V_{1i}-V_{0i}$$\n$$E(V_{1i}-V_{0i}) = E(v_{1i}|D_i=1)-E(v_{0i}|D_i=1)$$\n\n## Simple Difference in Difference Analysis\n[Another youtube video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5QOCMIwjbg\u0026ab_channel=MikeJonasEconometrics)\n\nEstimate impact of a treatment of a given outcome over time. impact of tutoring on students GPA?\n\nWant to look at the **difference in the changes** over time across groups.\nType B is treated.\nType A is the control group, did not receive treatment.\n$\\delta_{DD} =\\text{Effect of treatment on outcome } Y$\n$\\delta_{DD} =(\\bar{Y}_{B,2}-\\bar{Y}_{A,2})-(\\bar{Y}_{B,1}-\\bar{Y}_{A,1})$\nFormula: Differences after treatment minus differences before treatment.\n\nCan also be written:\n$\\delta_{DD} =(\\bar{Y}_{B,2}-\\bar{Y}_{B,1})-(\\bar{Y}_{A,2}-\\bar{Y}_{A,1})$\nFormula: How did things change if you where in the group B minus how did things change if you where in the group A\n\nCounterfactual Treatment Group outcome:\nWhat would the treatment group outcome be treatment, if treatment had not occurred? This can not be answered because we do not know, it can not be observed.\nIt would, by assumption, follow the same trend as the control group.\nCounterfactual outcome will be the original mean in period 1($Y_{B,1}$) plus the change experienced by the control group ($\\bar{Y}_{A,2}-\\bar{Y}_{A,1}$)\n\n|                  | Control (A) | Treated (B) | Counterfactual |\n| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| Pre-Treatment(1) |$Y_{A,1}$             |$Y_{B,1}$             |                |\n| Post-Treatment(2)|$Y_{A,2}$             |$Y_{B,2}$             |                |\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220927192205.png)\n\nParallel trends:\nWe must assume that the trends of dependent variable over time were identical between the treated and non-treated group prior to treatment.\nIn addition, we assume that the trends would have remained parallel, had it not been for the treatment. Thus any difference in trends can be attributed to the treatment effect.\n\nOLS:\nLet $D_{TREATi}=1$ if observation $i$ is in treatment group. $D_{POSTi}=1$ if observation $i$ occurs in post-treatment.\n$Y_i=b_0 + \\delta_T D_{TREATi} + \\delta_P D_{POSTi} + \\delta (D_{TREATi})(D_{POSTi})$\nOLS estimate of $\\delta_{DD}$ will git the ATE (Average Treatment Effect)\n\n## Frekonomics\nAbortion:\nLegalised abortion 1973 legal nation wide.
